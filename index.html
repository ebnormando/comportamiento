								<h3>Areas where I belong</h3>
								<p>I strongly believe that I can fulfill the CEO position of Hack The World due to my natural leadership to build great teams; experience in working with startups that needed a solid business plan and goals, and also objectives to track and measure progress, which is what I think this company is definitely missing in order to position itself as the best company to provide Hackathons as a new way to provide innovtion to industries in the country, because great ideas ar not much but that, without a solid business plan and organization to manage he project.<br/><br/></p>
