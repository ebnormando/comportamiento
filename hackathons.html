							<h2>What is missing?</h2>
							<p>Why is Hack The World 'almost' taking over the Hackathon market in Mexico.</p>
						</header>
						<!-- <span class="image featured"><img src="images/iohack.JPG" alt="" /></span> -->
					</section>
	<h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
							<p>It is important for this startup to undesrtand the actual context of the country in terms of technology and innovation in general terms, and approach potential clients with confidence, which can only be provided, in my experience, by spending money and giving the potential clients with an "example" of how a hackton for the client would be like, and the results that can be given to the company.<br/> 
						</p>
							<h2>Where should HTW start?</h2>
							<p>I strongly believe that Hack The World is actually missing 'cash flow' to enter the market more strong. So what I propose to be immediately done is the three following things:<p>
								1.- Raise capital: Enough to pay at least 5 programmers to enter the hackathons and so provide with results; it will also help HTW to make the client sure that at least, that they would get one prototipe by paying the amount of money that is requiered to make the hackathon; which is already doing what basic companies that develop technology do. <p>
								      <br/> 1.1.- Capital to pay for the "test hackathon", or a "mini hackathon" in order to provide the client with confidence that paying for a hackathon is highly worth it in terms of innovation, getting potential talent to work for the company, and also as a marketing tool to show consumers that you as a company are investing in developing technology in Mexico and so giving job opportunities for young mexicans. <br/>
								      <p> 2.- HTW needs to immediately start working on a Test Hackathon approach for its potential clients, and so redefine its business model including it.<p>
								      <p> 3. Organizational Culture: It is quite important for HTW's success to establish its organizational culture for everyone involved in every process to work in a healthy environment in wich everyone is empathic, and everyone supports any person of any area if an specific duty needs to be done, and the one in charged does not have time to get it done. HTW needs to work with values so that it can attract talent more easily without having to pay high amounts of money in salaries, but because people want to work there by choice, to help the startup succeed.<p>
